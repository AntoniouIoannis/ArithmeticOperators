# ArithmeticOperators
I made some Examples of execution of arithmetic operators.
Code in C#  .NET8  written in VISUAL STUDIO 2022.

I have also created an exe  file for  instant execution and result display, if you do not have the appropriate tools, to enter to my code and run from your IDE.
The file is the ArithmeticOperators.exe.
Thanks
Enjoy my work!
